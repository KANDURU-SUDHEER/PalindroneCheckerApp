# PalindroneCheckerApp
# UseCase2PalindromeCheckerApp – README

This application demonstrates a simple palindrome validation in Java using a hardcoded string value (`"madam"`). It compares characters from both ends of the string by incrementing a left pointer and decrementing a right pointer until they meet, determining whether the string reads the same forward and backward. The program introduces fundamental string comparison logic without using advanced data structures and prints the result to the console indicating whether the predefined text is a palindrome or not.
