This project demonstrates how to check whether a given string is a palindrome in Java.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Example:

    madam 
    
    racecar 
    
    hello 

 Goal :

    To check whether a string is a palindrome by:
    
    Reversing the string using a loop.
    
    Comparing the original string with the reversed string.
    
    Displaying the result.

 Program Flow :

    Initialize the original string.
    
    Use a for loop to iterate through the string in reverse order.
    
    Build the reversed string using string concatenation (+).
    
    Compare both strings using the equals() method.
    
    Print whether the string is a palindrome or not.
